This project is a multi-user console-based private chat application developed using Java sockets for 
real-time communication and MySQL JDBC for storing chat messages. The application facilitates 
direct messaging between users in a terminal-based interface. It is designed to be lightweight, 
easy to use, and fully functional from the command line without any GUI.

The server is multithreaded, allowing it to handle multiple clients simultaneously. 
Each client can view the list of online users and initiate a private chat with another user. 
All sent messages are persisted in a MySQL database for logging and historical reference.
